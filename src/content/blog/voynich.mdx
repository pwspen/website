I wrote a [python library](https://github.com/pwspen/pykeedy) to allow for easier computational analysis of the undeciphered medieval book, the [Voynich Manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript). 

You can [see here](https://github.com/pwspen/pykeedy/blob/main/analysis_summary.md) for some pretty plots that show the types of analysis that the library can do at the moment. 

The point of the library is to lower the barrier to entry for trying new analyses, as well as compare against various manuscripts in other languages.
