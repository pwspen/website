Between Sept 2021 and Apr 2022, I was on the propulsion team (~5 people) for XL-1, Masten Space Systems' NASA-contracted (through CLPS) lunar lander. I was in charge of routing and positioning most propulsion components inside the lander, including valves (various types), regulators, fittings, tubes, clamps, brackets, etc. I did this using Solidworks, and by coordinating with the structures, integration, and systems teams on topics like structural interfaces between propulsion and the vehicle, integration order and schedule, mass budgets, and everything else required to position the vehicle's propulsion system in a way that would interfere the least with other systems, make vehicle integration the easiest, and be strong enough to survive the trip to the moon.

I learned a massive amount about fluid system design through being on the XL-1 team, including tube bend considerations, support/structural requirements, insulation, material compatibility, how to make assembly/fabrication easy both for single tube runs and entire assemblies, pressure drop considerations/line balancing, plumbing and instrumentation diagram design, and the art of making easily-modifiable CAD, both parts and assemblies.

This role taught me a massive amount about in-space propulsion, vehicle design, mission design, and of course fluid system design. However, the skill that I improved through this role that I have most appreciated is much less technical: communication. I constantly communicated with a wide variety of people, and disagreements were not uncommon. Because of this, I really learned the value of concise, clear, respectful communication, and how to employ it to get results. This skillset has been invaluable since my time at Masten, during which I captained my school's 30-student rocket team through competing in the Spaceport America Cup to a finish in the top third of teams.

At Masten, I was also part of [VTVL rocket testing](/blog/xodiac-testing).
