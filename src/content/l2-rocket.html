<p>This is the rocket that got me my Tripoli Level 2 certification in June 2021. I call it Prismatic. It is 4&#8243; diameter, ~40&#8243; long, and weighed about 7lbs ready for flight. It flew dual deploy (two parachutes) with three altimeters. The scarfed tube fin design is definitely unique-looking, which was my goal (it certainly isn&#8217;t optimal aerodynamically!). </p>



<p>To build it, I designed the rocket in OpenRocket (rocket design/flight simulation software), designed the nosecone and internal avionics bay in Solidworks, 3D printed them, cut tubes to size, laser cut various internal wood components, set up the recovery system (parachutes), and programmed the onboard electronics. The specific method of fin attachment present here is somewhat unique even among other tube-fin rocket designs.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have video of its 2 flights, but they both went to around 3500&#8242; and both went perfectly. The first was on a J99 motor (average 99 newtons of thrust), which is special because it has a 10 second long burn, which it accomplishes by being an endburner. The second was a J200something and was fun but unremarkable. </p>



<p>Longburning motors are very cool. The J99 burn wasn&#8217;t finished even by the time the rocket was no longer visible. The flight went great, and even though it heavily weathercocked into the wind, the wind brought it almost right back to the launch pad.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the day was a bit of a trainwreck. I launched with only a few minutes left in the waiver, after taking the L2 test, because I showed up unprepared and took many hours to get to a launch-ready state. After I did the same thing for my L1 a month earlier. There&#8217;s nothing like experiencing two <em>extremely</em> hectic and stressful launch days to drill in the importance of checklists and prep.</p>
