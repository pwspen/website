        This is a project to make working wolverine claws.
      </p>

      <p class="m-2 w-full">
        I'm not really interested in cosplay, what I want is something that
        works (even if all I'm ever going to use it for is chopping fruit), and
        I'm kind of disappointed by the versions of the claws that people have
        made (there's lots on Youtube).
      </p>

      <p class="m-2 w-full">
        Specifically, nothing I've seen so far is both low-profile and
        practical. I want something that is long and sharp, can extend quickly,
        is very unlikely to extend accidentally, can be retracted easily (and
        with minimal other gear, like having to wear a pneumatic tank), and fits
        easily into the sleeve of a jacket. Basically, I want this thing to feel
        like it's really a functional part of my body.
      </p>

      <p class="m-2 w-full">
        The design I've settled on is pictured. The blades and some plates are
        metal, probably waterjetted. There will be some 3D printed parts to
        connect and align parts. There will be only two things strapped to the
        arm: the on-hand structural support / aligner and the smaller on-wrist
        structural support. There will be a spring powering extension, a knob
        for manual retraction (maybe motorized later), a rail to align the blade
        assembly as it slides, and two controls on the palm to trigger extension
        and lock and unlock the blade position.
      </p>

      <p class="m-2 w-full">
        The length of the blades is limited by forearm length; the design I have
        right now should just about go to my elbow when retracted. The blades
        extend about 6 inches past the knuckles.
