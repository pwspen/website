<p>This is the rocket that got me my Level 1 certification in May 2021. It is about 2&#8243; diameter, about 8&#8242; long, and around 5lbs. I call it Scrapheap because it was mostly built out of parts I found laying around unused in my rocket team&#8217;s workshop. Most of its length is empty tube, I just wanted to make a really long rocket.</p>



<p>I designed it in OpenRocket (design/simulation software), cut the fiberglass body tubes to size, epoxied on the plywood fins, machined a metal coupler, laser cut various internal plywood parts, set up the recovery system with proper parachutes and shock cord, and programmed the settings for the onboard electronics.</p>



<p>This was my first foray into rocketry. It had two altimeters and two parachutes. Looking back now, the name &#8220;Scrapheap&#8221; is even more applicable because of how awful the build quality was, but I didn&#8217;t know that at the time..</p>



<p>It flew once, to about 900&#8242;, and had a perfect flight in spite of a very rushed launch day. Launch video below.</p>
