        <p class="m-2 w-full">This is a semester-long school project (the 'capstone'/thesis class). I lead a team of 4 mechanical engineering students in the development of a 3D printer that can print
            normal thermoplastics and an epoxy-fiber mixture. The project was intended as a tech demonstrator to show the potential of printing with chopped-fiber-epoxy
            mixtures; they have the potential to greatly increase the strength to weight of 3D printed parts at a relatively low cost, and entirely automated.</p>

        <p class="m-2 w-full">My team collaborated with an additive manufacturing lab for this project. The lab gave us the idea of a thermoplastic + thermoset 
            printer (epoxy) (these are uncommon but certainly exist) and I came up with the idea of adding in chopped fiber (novel as far as I can find). </p>

        <p class="m-2 w-full">I did the vast majority of the design work for this project, including most CAD, circuit design, code, etc. I also made the poster at the top of the page on my own.</p>
