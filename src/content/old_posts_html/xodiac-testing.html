<p>Between Sept &#8211; Nov 2021, I was a member of the testing team for Xodiac, Masten (now Astrobotic)&#8217;s testbed VTVL rocket. </p>



<p>I was on the test team for 6 total flights: 4 tethered to a forklift and 2 free. I performed various checkouts: valve operation (pictured above), torque stripes, leak, and electrical. I also armed the flight termination system and assisted with propellant and pressurant fill (including cryogenic), vehicle transportation, and test equipment preparation. Xodiac has 100+ completed launches and landings.</p>



<p>Xodiac&#8217;s test team was small, ranging between 5 and 10 people, so I was an important part of the team and relied on, as I relied on my coworkers. </p>



<p>This experience (and helping with various small-engine static fire tests) taught me a massive amount about test engineering and operating under tense, time-sensitive conditions, where a mistake could have cascading consequences. Thankfully, every test I was part of was a full success, but there were a lot of problems the team had to solve to get them all to that point.</p>



<p>For the flights I was involved in, Xodiac&#8217;s payload was ExoCam, which is a camera in a impact-resistant frame that can be ejected from landers close to the surface of a celestial body and record video of the landing. Its testing on Xodiac was aimed at demonstrating capability and working out kinks to prepare for eventually operating on the moon.</p>



<p>At Masten, I was also on the <a href="/portfolio/projects/xl-1.html">propulsion team for the XL-1 lunar lander</a>.</p>
